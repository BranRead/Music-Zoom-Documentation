# Music-Zoom-Documentation
Just a repository of images and a description of my time with this app
## Description
### This is an app designed to be used by people who have low vision. It allows them to read sheet music and therefore play with a band. 
### It can of course be used by anyone, however, UI choices and features are optimized for people with low vision. 
## Features
### The owner of the source code wants it to stay confidential. I'll share a few things about the project just to explain the app a bit more.
### The images show the title screen, the part of the app where the user crops PDFs, the main part of the app and the settings UI.
### My role was front-end implementation. My partner did the back-end and the inital mock up of the app.
### Basically the user will download sheet music in the form of a PDF onto their Android device. They can then choose that file to crop out sections of it. 
### When cropped a grey overlay will be added to the section added to that array of images that can be later saved. The user can undo actions before saving.
### When the user saves, the song can be named and then it's auto-opened in the main part of the app. (The user can also load previously saved songs and go directly to this part of the app.)
### From here the the array of sheet music is displayed in a scrolling continuous line.
### The user can annotate the sheet music however they wish, and place repeats. 
### The repeats let the user repeat parts of sheet music as is required by pieces of music. 
### The repeat starts red and then changes to a green dashed line when the user will be continuing past the repeated section. 
### They can scroll with their finger or using the buttons at the bottom. 
### If a bluetooth controller is connected, the user can also use that to navigate the sheet music. This is something which requires changing code to make it work with different controllers at the point in development we got the app to.
### There is a basic settings menu for inverting colours, changing the distance the sheet music is scrolled by each time and how fast this takes place.
